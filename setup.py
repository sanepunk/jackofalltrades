        ```python
        import jackofalltrades as joft
        from jackofalltrades.datasets import get_data
        # Load data and split into training and testing sets
        ldset = get_dataset()
        X, y = ldset.get_btc()
        # Train a linear regression model
        model = joft.Models.LinearRegression(X, y)
        model.fit()
        # Make predictions and evaluate performance
        y_predicted = model.predict(X)
        model.evaluate(y, y_predicted)
        ```
